## General Information
- A python program to study the risk behaviour of the loan application for the provide loan data set.
- The application of EDA is to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.
- If the loan applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.
- We have been provided with the Private Data of Lending Club. The complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 to 2011.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Approximately 14% of loans in the provided dataset are defaulted.

- Maximum number of loan disbursed is from 5000 to 10000. Maximum number of loan disbursed in the year 2011 alone which is more than 50%.

- Predominantly, most of the loan applicant either have mortgage something or living in a rented place, and the same category reflects for the defaulters, combining both of them are 93% of default case.

- Giving loan for debt consolidation purpose is a riskier business, more than half of them (out of total default case) can default.

- 10+ years employees contribute for loan defaulting upto 30%, i.e., one third of total default cases.

- Avoid giving loan to the applicant who has even one public derogatory record.

- When dept payment to income ratio is higher than 15, they are likely to default.

- Other than very income group, annual income does not affect the loan defaulting.

- Grade employee (E, F & G) have given the most profits to the lending company with high interest rate suitably with 15-22% rate.

- States WY has the highest average(median) loan amount that was charged off. This state must be looked into by the LC for further investigation.
